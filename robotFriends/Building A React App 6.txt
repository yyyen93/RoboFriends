Building A React App 6
- Organize & structure files.
- Clean up the files.
- Create few folders
    - components : for pure function component
        - CardList, SearchBox, Scroll
    - containers : for smart component, have 'state',have 'lifecycle hooks'
        - App.js, SEGA.woff

../container/App
../components/CardList

'..' means leave the folder and go into the container or components.


App.js
1) There is an easy way to write this line of codes
    - robots.length is is consider false
        - So, we want the opposite
            - (robots.length) is 0 false
            - (!robots.length) is 1 true
    -Which means 
        - Its 'true'  If server response slow and no robots, it will return LOADING
        - Its 'false If server get robots and it will return the components.
            !robots.length means true
            robots.length means false
2) Make this code into ternary:
Code: 
    if(!robots.length){
      return <h1>LOADING</h1> //LOADING BAR
    }else{
      return(
        <div className="tc">  
          <h1>RoboFriends</h1>
          <SearchBox searchChange={this.onSearchChange}/>
          <Scroll>
            <CardList robots={filteredRobots}/> 
          </Scroll>
        </div>
      )

Ternary Code:
return !robots.length ?
       <h1>LOADING</h1> : //LOADING BAR
      (
        <div className="tc">  
          <h1>RoboFriends</h1>
          <SearchBox searchChange={this.onSearchChange}/>
          <Scroll>
            <CardList robots={filteredRobots}/> 
          </Scroll>
        </div>
      )

run build
- created a new folder called 'build', we will have a 'build' file that are optimized.
- JS, CS all are minified.
- EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DEPLOY A WEBSITE IS IN 'BUILD' FOLDER'.
