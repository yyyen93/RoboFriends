Building A React App 3
- Make it interactive
- Create App.js component
- Create a searchBox 
- Create a Title
- Create SearchBox.js component

###index.js
1)I think now that we're officially building an app, instead of having the 'CardList' component, we should have one big component called
- App.js
this 'App' will be the father of all our children, all our component.
2)Add import App from './App';
3)Removed import CardList from './CardList';
4)Removed <CardList robots={robots} />
5)Removed import {robots} from './robots';
6)Render <App />



###App.js
1)Add <CardList robots={robots} />  in <div></div>
2)Add import CardList from './CardList';
3)Add import {robots} from './robots';
4)Add <h1>RoboFriends</h1> title
5)Add import SearchBox from './SearchBox';
6)Add <SearchBox /> component
7)Add className="tc" to <div></div>
8)The <SearchBox /> component need to communicate with the <CardList robots={robots}/> component. <CardList /> need to know what is in the <SearchBox /> component, so it can filter out robots accordingly.
9) PLEASE REFER TO 'ONE WAY DATA FLOW REACT' DOCUMENT.
10)Add 'state'
11)convert the pure function App into class.
   - pure function : const App = () => {}
   - class : class App extends Component{}
12)Add shorthand {Component} to react : import React, {Component} from 'react';
13)class always has a render() and return() inside render().
14) How can we add 'state' in react? Ans is do a constructor.
15) In order to use 'this' keyword, we need to call 'super()' which calls the constructor of component.
16) this.state is what describe our app. The props inside the state is something that can change and affect our app. Stage is usually in parent component and the component that is the parent that just passes the ‘state’ to different components.
17)Now, the 'child' component 'CardList' can receives the props from 'state' from the parent(App.js) by using 'this.state.robots'.
18)The way to communicate between CardList and SearchBox. Right now, we had both values. We can create a function for SearchBox called 'onSearchChange()'
19)'onSearchChange(event)' : everytime the input changes, we will get an event parameter. 
    - Pass the function in the <SearchBox /> component, i can say <SearchBox searchChange = {this.onSearchChange}/>.
    - Because class App is an object, we have to use 'this' keyword. And 'onSearchChange()'is 'searchChange'.
    - Pass the searchChange props to SearchBox.js : const SearchBox = ({searchChange}) =>{}
20)Something need to REMEMBER, within the 'event' keyword, there is always have 'event.target.value', which give us the value of the search term.
21)Everytime SearchBox Changes,
    - it’s going to run the onChange function call searchChange.
    - searchChange function is a prop of the ‘onSearchChange’ function that defined in App.js
    - But now that I have the value of the search input, I can now directly communicate that search input to robots list
22)Add const filteredRobots = this.state.robots
    -The robots is an array and how we access 'state' is we going to use 'filter' to filter the array.
    - Give it 'robot', and our array will have to return a condition
        -const filteredRobots = this.state.robots.filter(robot =>{
        return
     })
    - The condition is going to be 
        -return robot.name.toLowerCase() : this is a method that comes with all strings, it just makes everything lowercase.
        (THIS IS GOOD FOR COMPARISONS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO COMPARE CAPITALIZED OR LOWERCASE)
        -And the robots.name which is now lowercased, and includes() the this.searchfield.toLowerCase(), which means if anything in the string includes 'toLowerCase()', then only it return the robots that returns true.
    -Code:
    const filteredRobots = this.state.robots.filter(robot => {
        return robot.name.toLowerCase().includes(this.searchfield.toLowerCase());
    });
    -EVERYTIME MAKE YOUR OWN METHODS ON A COMPONENT, MAKE SURE USE ARROW FUNCTION SYNTAX. OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET AN ERROR REGARDING TO 'STATE'
23)if the searchfield is not filtering and showing 10 robots in the terminal. its because the 'searchfield' is always an empty string.
    -IN ORDER TO UPDATE THE 'state'
        -AGAIN, ANOTHER RULE OF REACT IS TO DO 
            - 'this.setState' : A method that comes with React.
            - Anytime you want to change 'STATE', you always have to do this. 
            - We are using an object, so 'searchfield' is now going to be 'event.target.value'
            - Code:
            this.setState({searchfield: event.target.value})
            -After set this,it will changed the props 'searchfield' in the state, everything is being filtered and always gets updated.
24)Now, filteredRobots can be used as props instead of 'this.state.robots'
    - Move the variable filteredRobots from onSearchChange function to render()
    - So this allow to access filteredRobots
    Old:
    <CardList robots = {this.state.robots}/>
    New:
    <CardList robots = {filteredRobots}/>
25) CONCLUSION:
- We have 'App' component that has two 'state'
    - robots:robots
    - searchfield:''
Because 'App' owns the 'state', any component that has 'state' uses 
- 'class' syntax
So they can use the 
- 'constructor' function to create 'this.state'
- 'this.state' is what changes in the app, its what describes the app
-The virtual DOM is just a javascript object. The DOM is just object that collects this entire 'state' and React uses 'this.state' to render and pass them down as props to '<CardList />' and <SearchBox/> components that are just pure functions that can render.
-We always know that the App is going to look the same, because they're just simple pure functions.
-We managed the 'state' in the constructor and the App is the only thing that can change this state. But it can pass down things such as props. So we passed down 'onSearchChange' to the 'SearchBox' and the 'SearchBox', everytime there's an 'onChange' on the input, It will let the 'App' know, "Hey, there was a change", "Run the 'onSearchChange' function". It runs the function with the event and updates the 'State' of the 'searchfield' to whatever we type.
-Now with the information that we have from the 'searchBox', we can now communicate to the 'CardList' and tell it "Hey, i want to filter the 'robots' state to now have only what includes in the 'searchfield'". And instead of passing that 'this.state' to our 'robots', we just passed the 'filteredRobots'






###SearchBox.js
1)function that returns an input.
2)Add <input type="search" placeholder="Search Robots" />
3)Is always a good idea incase to add more things to the search box, is to wrap everything in a '<div></div>'.
4)Add className="pa2" to <div></div>
5)Add className="pa3 ba b--green bg-lightest-blue" to <input />
6)Add {searchChange} props from App.js in searchBox.js : 
    - const SearchBox = ({searchChange}) =>{}
7)Remember in HTML, i can do 'onchange html' event, which listening to 'input changes'.
